# CHAPTER-2-PORTFOLIO

Creating a "Hello World" App in Flutter
In this project, I created a simple "Hello World" app using Flutter to familiarize myself with the basic setup and structure of a Flutter application. After installing the Flutter SDK and setting up Visual Studio Code with the necessary plugins, I created a new project using the flutter create hello_world_app command. The app displays the text "Hello World" in the center of the screen using the Text widget, wrapped in a Center widget for alignment, and is structured with MaterialApp and Scaffold for basic layout.

Running the app on an emulator, I was able to see the output and use Flutter's hot reload feature to quickly test changes. This exercise helped me understand Flutter's widget-based architecture, including the use of key components like Scaffold for layout and Text for displaying text, and gave me hands-on experience with Flutter's development tools. Overall, creating this app gave me the foundation to start building more complex Flutter applications.
